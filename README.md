# Scrabble-AI

This is my Scrabble AI project I'm doing just cause. 

The goal I have is to create a bruteforce bot which just picks the highest-scoring word every turn, then to create something which can beat that.

Test cases are in testing.py. Currently it can find the best move on an empty board.
To see two greedy bots play against each other, run greedymirror.py

Blank spaces aren't implemented, and also the bots can only makes horizontal moves atm. Working on fixing that. Also, the bots get stuck in some circumstances.
